/// <summary>
/// Represents the field of complex p-adic numbers, denoted ℂₚ in mathematics.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// ℂₚ is the algebraic closure and completion of ℚₚ with respect to the p-adic norm. It contains all solutions to 
/// algebraic equations over ℚₚ, as well as transcendental numbers. Thus, ℂₚ generalizes ℚₚ by extending it to 
/// include both algebraic and transcendental elements.
/// <para>
/// ℂₚ contains the following sets of numbers:
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><description>ℚ: All rational numbers.</description></item>
/// <item><description>ℚₚ: All ultimately periodic p-adic numbers.</description></item>
/// <item><description>ℂ: All complex numbers, including imaginary numbers like √(-1).</description></item>
/// <item><description>All algebraic numbers over ℚₚ.</description></item>
/// </list>
/// </para>
/// ℂₚ is closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, logarithms, and square roots. 
/// It supports all operations on complex numbers within the p-adic framework.
/// </remarks>
/// <example>
/// The square root of -1 does not exist in ℚₚ but exists in ℂₚ, yielding the imaginary unit i.
/// <para>A 5-adic expansion for the rational number i (√-1) is:</para>
/// <code>
/// √(-1) = i = "…04240422331102414131141421404340423140223032431212"₅ (no repeating pattern)
/// </code>
/// This is the OEIS sequence <a href="https://oeis.org/A210850">A210850</a>, the other OEIS sequences for <c>i</c> is <a href="https://oeis.org/A210851">A210851</a>
